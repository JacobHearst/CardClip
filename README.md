# ScryfallClipboard

A browser extension that adds clipboard functionality for Scryfall

This project was created in an attempt to address my own personal struggles with using Scryfall while deckbuilding. Its only job is to allow a user to collect cards as they search on Scryfall and then allow them to copy those cards to their clipboard for use elsewhere.

### Downloads
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scryfall-clipboard/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/card-clip/npglimimpnllddjddphoagcngmiipkkc?hl=en)

### Guiding Principles

1. Don't modify or obstruct any existing Scryfall functionality.
2. This is NOT a deckbuilding service. Make no assumptions about what the user is collecting cards for
