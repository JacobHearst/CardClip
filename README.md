# ScryfallClipboard

An EDHREC-like clipboard functionality for Scryfall

This project was created in an attempt to address my own personal struggles with using Scryfall while deckbuilding. Its only job is to allow a user to collect cards as they search on Scryfall and then allow them to copy those cards to their clipboard for use elsewhere.

### Guiding Principles:

1. Don't modify or obstruct any existing Scryfall functionality.
2. This is NOT a deckbuilding service. Make no assumptions about what the user is collecting cards for

### Planned Featurelist

- [x] Add/remove card from card clipboard
- [x] Copy card clipboard to the user's clipboard
- [x] Persist card clipboard in local storage
- [ ] Clear card clipboard
- [ ] View card clipboard
